Answer to Question One:
I do not think a unit test would be all that is needed for a message feature test.  The message feature has way too many moving components to be covered in one test.  Each component could be tested but the entire thing needs numerous rounds of unit testing

Answer to Question two:
Here I would unit test.  This is a test of a single function of the application that only tests that the user does not input too large of a message.  Since this does not have the extraneous components and can be tested as it is alone, this would be a good idea.
